	 <h3> Coordinates: 13°29′N 16°41′W</h3>
<h3>About</h3>
Bakau is a town on the Atlantic coast of Gambia, west of Gambia's capital city of Banjul. It is known for its botanical gardens, its crocodile pool Bakau Kachikally and for the beaches at Cape Point. Bakau is the first major suburb outside Banjul and the most developed town in the Gambia. Close to Bakau and Banjul is Gambia's largest city, Serekunda.<br>

<strong>History</strong><br>
Legend has it that Bakau grew up around the holy crocodile pool in Kachikally, the central district of Bakau. Bakau itself was a small village at the turn of the 19th century and grew in importance as it became a favourite place for private residences of colonial administrators, especially along the beautiful palm fringed beaches. Despite being a major town, the old village still exists and is run like any other in the Gambia, with an 'Alkali' (similar to 'Mayor') and divided into Kabilos. There exists a much smaller village within the old village called Bakau Wasulung Kunda, indicating the migrant origins of its inhabitants. As people began to move out of Banjul, government allocated residential areas quickly sprang around the old village, acquiring new names in the process. What were farms of the local population became well planned suburbs filled with bungalows, such as Fajara, New Town and Cape Point.<br>

<strong>Economy</strong><br>
Tourism is the most important business activity in Bakau providing a lot of employment, as well as income for the municipal authority. At Cape Point there are a few hotels on a beach, arguably superior to the main Atlantic ocean beach, which is home to most of the hotels in the country. In town there are a few guest houses. There is also a major market along the main road famous for its fruit and vegetables. Most banks have branches there and several companies also maintain offices there.
<br>
Fishing is also another major business activity and there is a fishing port by the town beach, together with a wharf where a market attracts many visitors. One of the few ice plants in the country is located there. Afrinat International Airlines had its head office in Bakau.

<br>
<strong>Education</strong><br>
Bakau Primary school, established in 1947, is one of the oldest schools in the country. Today there are other lower basic schools as well a several high schools, both public and private. The Medical Research Council is also located within a fenced complex. The MRC has a long history in the Gambia and is a leading global centre of excellence in malaria research.

	<div data-role="content">	
		<img src="state/banjul.png"  alt=""/>
		<h3>Coordinates: 13°27′11″N 16°34′39″W</h3>

<h3>About</h3>
Banjul, officially the City of Banjul and formerly known as Bathurst, is the capital of the Gambia and is in a division of the same name. The population of the city proper is only 34,828, with the Greater Banjul Area, which includes the City of Banjul and the Kanifing Municipal Council, at a population of 357,238 (2003 census).Banjul is on St Mary's Island (Banjul Island), where the Gambia River enters the Atlantic Ocean. The island is connected to the mainland to the west and the rest of Greater Banjul Area via bridges. There are also ferries linking Banjul to the mainland at the other side of the river.<br>

<strong>Etymology</strong><br>
Banjul takes its name from the Mandé people who gathered specific fibres on the island, which were used in the manufacture of ropes. Bang julo is the Mandinka (Mande) word for rope fibre. The mispronunciation led to the word Banjul. <br>

<strong>History</strong><br>
In 1651 Banjul was leased by The Duke of Courland and Semigallia (German: Herzog von Kurland und Semgallen) from the King of Kombo, as part of the Couronian colonization.<br>

In 1816, the British founded Banjul as a trading post and base for suppressing the slave trade. The British renamed Banjul Island as St. Mary's Island and first named Bathurst after The 3rd Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time. The name was changed to Banjul in 1973.<br>

On 22 July 1994 Banjul was the scene of a bloodless military coup d'état in which President Sir Dawda Jawara was overthrown and replaced by the country's current President Yahya Jammeh. To commemorate this event, Arch 22 was built as an entrance portal to the capital. The gate is 35 metres tall and stands at the centre of an open square. It houses a textile museum.<br>

Attractions in the city include the Gambian National Museum, the Albert Market, Banjul State House, Banjul Court House, African Heritage Museum, two cathedrals and several major mosques.<br>

<strong>Economy</strong><br>
Banjul is the country's economic and administrative centre and includes the Central Bank of the Gambia. Peanut processing is the country's principal industry, but beeswax, palm wood, palm oil, and skins and hides are also shipped from the port of Banjul.<br>

Banjul is also the home of the Gambia Technical Training Institute. GTTI is currently engaged in a partnership with non-profit organization Power Up Gambia to develop a solar energy training program.<br>

<strong>Transport</strong><br>
As of May, 2014 ferries sail regularly from Banjul across the River Gambia to Barra. The city is served by the Banjul International Airport. Banjul is on the Trans–West African Coastal Highway connecting it to Dakar and Bissau, and will eventually provide a paved highway link to 11 other nations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

        Brufut, The Gambia is a town located in the Western Division of the Gambia. The town of Brufut is situated a couple of kilometres inland from the coastal road, but the name Brufut is applied to an area extending from around the town, out to the coast. It has a main street with a market, and some government offices, it is reached via a 'red' sandy unmade road from the coastal road, from Brusabi on one side to Ghana Town on the other side. The area is a fast developing location because of its highly developed infra structure. It is easy to reach from the capital, Banjul, the economic centre, Serrekunda, and the tourist area of the Sennegambia Strip by the AU Coastal Highway from the turntable in Brusabi going towards Tanjii and situated on a slight hill giving direct views to the unspoiled sandy beaches and the Atlantic Ocean.

The estate is very popular with UK expatriates. There will eventually be approximately 450 villas (parts of the estate are still under construction in 2013), that include three large apartment blocks and a brand new Shopping Mall. Next to this is another gated and guarded area of the estate known as the AU Village, which was constructed in early 2006 by the Gambia/Government and TAF Construction purposely to have a secure place to lodge the 52 presidents expected to attend the then 7th AU summit in the Gambia. Today these are used to lodge VIPs and are for sale to the general public. The area, this village is built on is next to a holy place called Sanmentereng. It has a long cultural background being a "holy" area where people came to in order to pray for their future hopes and wishes to come true.
<br>
Brufut also has one of the Gambia's finest hotels, the five-star Sheraton Gambia Resort, which overlooks a beautiful beach. The hotel with its well featured large conference facilities was one of the main locations for the 7th AU Summit, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the major sessions of the conference and lodging the presidents offices. Other hotels include Hibiscus House, located in the heart of the village of Brufut.
<br>
Nearby is the world famous Tanjii Bird Reserve (Tel. 9816799) with a small entrance fee and building a new visitors centre in 2013 this is an area well worth visiting, with its acres of scrubs and a coastal lagoon, housing hundreds of species of birds and some mammals. It links up to the Tanjii fishing village across the Tanjii river. Behind Brufut Town are the Brufut woods area also renowned for bird watching. Both these sites are extremely peaceful.
