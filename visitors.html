   <strong>Where to Stay</strong><br>
<p>
In Gambia, hotel accommodation resorts offer a wide and varied choice of places to stay ranging from luxury or standard tourist hotels to guest houses, lodges and self-catering apartments. <br>

As for those looking for alternative boarding on a short or longer term basis with own kitchen there are holiday rentals which includes apartments, villas and bungalows with some additional services such as a cook or security provided by the property's owner. And finally there are houses for rent or even houses for sale for people looking for long-term stays in Banjul.<br>

The majority of tourists who visit the Gambia have already booked their rooms in an all-inclusive deal with one of the major tour operators. Rooms in the Senegambia Beach, Sarges, Kairaba Hotel, in Kololi, are frequently heavily booked in the winter tourist season which runs from mid-October through to April. It is strongly advised that visitors confirm accommodation bookings before making their outbound trip. However, it is still always possible to find a last minute room during the busy tourist season as there are numerous small guest houses and lodges near the coastal holiday resorts of Kololi, Kotu and Bijilo.<br>

Most hotels are located on or near the coastal strip (about 10 kilometres west of the capital, Banjul) in the tourist resorts of Senegambia (Kololi), Kotu, Fajara, Bakau, Bijilo and Kerr Sering. Apart from the beach and coastal areas there are many rooms in purpose built complexes located up-country in rural area locations or by the riverside which would appeal to eco-tourists and independent travellers. For budget travellers there are numerous guest houses and lodges dotted around the fringes of the main resorts as well as further up-country. It is also possible to stay with local families if you have the right local connections though this is not advisable on your first visit.
Currently the most rapid development is taking place along the coastal region between Bijilo to Kartong in South Gambia with Brufut having seen the opening of the Sheraton 5 star resort.

    <p><strong>What to Eat</strong><br>
		One of the major reasons for people returning to The Gambia time and time again is the quality and diversity of the cuisine available - you'll definitely not go hungry! <br>

The Gambia is renowned for its abundant supply of fresh sea food; lady fish, barracuda, butter fish, atlantic prawns are just some you will find on many menus. In beach bars in the south of the country you can order the 'catch of the day' and the staff will go to the local fishing village and purchase some of the freshly caught fish for you.<br>

<strong>Traditional Gambian Dishes</strong>
<br>
There are four main traditional Gambian dishes which can be made with fish, meat or chicken.
<ul>
<li>Benachin - Rice cooked with meat or fish and vegetables and tomatoes.</li>
<li>Domoda - Meat stewed in peanut puree and served with rice.</li>
<li>Superkanja - A mix of okra, fish or meat, palm oil, onions and pepper boiled together.</li>
<li>Chicken Yassa - Chicken cooked with fresh lime, onions and ground black pepper.</li>
</ul>
There is a wide variety of restaurants in The Gambia ranging from casual beach bars to formal gourmet dining, serving a range of cuisine from Italian to Lebanese.The dress code in most restaurants is casual, but in the evening gentlemen usually wear long trousers. Depending on your hotel, some of the restaurants may be a taxi ride away but these are reasonably priced and can be pre-booked with waiting time until you are ready to return to your hotel.
</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What to Drink</strong><br>
      <p>With only a few exceptions, Gambian bars and restaurants are more frequented by tourists than locals. Many Gambians don't drink alcohol, and most prefer to entertain at home, only eating out when away from home or on business.</p>
<strong>Regional Drinks:</strong> 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Jul Brew is the local speciality beer. </li>
<li>Attaya (strong and sweet home-brewed tea).</li>
<li>Freshly pressed and mixed fruit juice is sold from beach stalls. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The following is a list of some of the common lcal food and drink <br>
<strong>  Afra</strong><br>
Afra is a very popular late night snack. Typically you’ll select your choice of meat which will be chopped up in front of you, seasoned and grilled then served with mustard or a spicy sauce.<br>

<strong>Akara</strong><br>
Akara is a delicious local dish served for breakfast sometimes in tapalapa bread. It’s made from black-eyed peas, grounded into flour and deep-fried. You’ll also find them on the breakfast menu at some other hotels including Kombo Beach Hotel which offers a daily Gambian breakfast specialty. Akara is a favourite but others include Oleleh and Abala, street food snacks, again made from black-eyed peas, and traditionally come wrapped in a banana leaf.<br>

<strong>Baobab Juice</strong><br>
Made from the fruit of the giant baobab trees, this pale brown, non-alcoholic drink is delicious and good for you, being full of vitamins, calcium and fibre.<br>

<strong>Benechin</strong><br>
Benechin literaly means <strong>one pot</strong> and can be cooked with chicken or other meat but fish is probably the most common variation. Ingredients include tomatoes, carrots, spring onions, sweet potatoes, onions, aubergine, cassava, bitter tomatoes and butternut squash. Chilli is also an important ingredient. This dish is also referred to as Jollof rice.<br>

<strong>Domada</strong>: <br>
This peanut based dish is probably the most cooked dish in The Gambia and comes served with white rice.  Domada is made from peanuts with tomato paste, mustard, black pepper and onions.<br>

<strong>Okra Stew</strong>:<br>
Also known as Superkanja, this stew is made with beef, fish, onions and, of course, okra and sometimes prawns or crabs.<br>

<strong>Palm Wine</strong>:<br>
Made by collecting the sap from the top of certain palm trees, this cloudy white drink can vary from a sweet and mildly alcoholic drink when freshly collected (especially from a tree that hasn’t been tapped before) to a sour and much stronger drink, after the sap has been allowed to naturally ferment for a few hours. It gets stronger over the nest day or so but if left too long turns  into vinegar.<br>

<strong>Tapalapa</strong><br>
This bread looks much like a french stick and is commonly eaten for breakfast with jam.<br>

<strong>Wonjo Juice</strong><br>
A delicious and refreshing non-alcoholic drink made from dried hibiscus (sorrel) flowers and sugar.<br>

<strong>Yassa</strong><br>
This is another common dish that you’ll often find on restaurant menus, usually in the form of Chicken Yassa. The chicken is cooked with chillies,  lime, onions and mustard and a stock cube of Maggi cubes, a popular ingredient in the Gambia. Variations that you’ll sometimes find include beef, fish, prawn or vegetable.<br>

    <strong>What to wear</strong><br>
    <p>
    </p>
    <strong>General  Tips</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Casual, comfortable clothes are the key when traveling in The Gambia.</li>
        <li>During the day it's hot, so our advice is to pack lightweight, loose fitting clothes in natural fabrics such as linen, silk and cotton that will keep you cool and are easy to wash and dry.</li>
        <li>Avoid blue or black clothing<strong> </strong>- the tsetse flies are drawn to these colors, and their bite can give you African Sleeping Sickness.</li>
        <li>The Gambia enjoys virtually uninterrupted sunshine and high daytime temperatures, and experiences only small fluctuations in temperature from winter to summer and on the coast. Wear plenty of sunscreen, sunglasses and a sunhat.</li>
        <li>Mosquitoes<strong> </strong>are most active around late afternoon and through the evening. We strongly recommend you take a good insect/mosquito repellent with you. Wearing long sleeved shirts and pants will also help.</li>
        <li>Don&rsquo;t drink or even brush your teeth in tap water. Consider taking a Water-to-Go Filtration Water Bottle.</li>
      </ul>
      
   <strong> Clothing Tips for Women</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>An advice would be to keep swimwear to the beach and pool, and cover up with a kaftan or sarong when walking around public areas.</li>
          <li>A skirt or loose-fitting pants are good in the heat and will protect you from the sun. </li>
          <li>A few well chosen pieces of costume jewellery will transform any outfit.</li>
        </ul>
        
      <strong> Clothing Tips for Men</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Although dress is not formal, in the evenings most hotels and restaurants require men to wear shirts and long pants.</li>
          </ul>
     <strong> Clothing Tips for the Weather</strong>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>The heaviest rainfall is in August and September and, while it mostly takes place at night, a light raincoat or umbrella would be a good idea.</li>
              <li>January, February, March and April evenings and early mornings can be cooler and a lightweight jacket or pashmina shawl would be a useful item to pack.</li>

	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
  <p>
  Located midway between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, The Gambia enjoys virtually uninterrupted sunshine and high daytime temperatures with almost no rainfall from November to June.
  On the coast, The Gambia experiences only small fluctuations in temperature from winter to summer however from July to October the humidity level is high as the tropical sun will be punctuated by short but spectacular showers.<br>
Although the months of heaviest rainfall are August and September, we have found that most rain occurs at night and has not detracted from our clients enjoyment of their holiday. Nevertheless, a lightweight rainmac or umbrella may prove useful in these months. Between January and April evenings and early mornings can be cooler than people expect. For those planning to travel inland away from the coast and the benefit of the sea breezes, it is important to note that temperatures during the summer can reach 42°C.

    <P>
<strong>Getting Around The Gambia</strong>  <br>  The Gambia is a very easy country to navigate; and providing you have a strong will and plenty of patience you can get pretty much anywhere.
   	 <br>
<strong>Taxis</strong><br>
Tour operators use comfortable air-conditioned coaches for their transfers and 4-wheel drives for their excursions. For those wishing to adventure out to their own or small groups, there are three different taxi services in The Gambia.<br>

<strong>Tourist Taxis</strong><br>
These are mostly painted green and have a "tourist taxi" sign on their cars. These taxis are licensed by The Gambia Tourism Board and dedicated to serve tourists and other visitors.  They are normally parked outside the hotels or resort areas. They operate on a queue system and have a published tariff for all distance within The Gambia and outside.  However, we recommend you to check with the driver before departure. It is normal to tip these drivers.<br>

<strong>Yellow and Green Taxis</strong><br>
These are mainly 4-passenger saloon cars painted in these colours, which run a shared taxi service between short distances or parked at the roadside for individual hire (also called a "Town trip"). The green ones (tourist cabs) and yellow ones (regular cabs)<br>

<strong>Collective (Bus) taxis</strong><br>
The most common way of travelling in The Gambia for locals is by collective taxis otherwise called "Bush" taxis. These are mainly 7-passenger cars, vans, minibuses and buses. They do not have a single colour and they operate a shared service between both short and long distances. They have a set fare. Please ask for the fair before you board the vehicle. They can make several on the way to allow passenger to board or disembark.<br>

<strong>Car Rental</strong><br>
There are several car rental companies in The Gambia. Check with your hotel receptionist or at the airport for details. Visitor wishing to have a self- drive should either present should possess  an International driving permit, which is accepted for a period of three months or a UK driving license, which can be used for a short visit.

		<h1>Shoping</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
      <p>
        There are numerous craft markets in The Gambia and shops selling all kinds of things - from hand made wooden artefacts to beautiful batiks and tablecloths. 

Banjul's Albert Market and the sprawling commercial heart of the busy town of Serrekunda are particularly colourful places to browse, Bargaining is the name of the game - for everything from fruit, to shoes to souvenirs!

You can expect to reduce the price by anything from 25% to 50%. Of particularly good value are elaborate wood carvings, items handcrafted out of straw, leather and cloth, African music cassettes, silver jewellery (buy with caution), sand paintings and batik pictures. The Gambian tailors have a great reputation for making almost anything to order at a very reasonable price.
          Popular purchases include colourful batik wall hangings, handmade clothing, woodcarvings, bead jewellery and traditional djembé drums. Beaded belts and ladies' handbags are also popular, as are books and albums made from recycled paper and West African handicrafts using straw, beads, leather, cloth or metal.<br>
          <strong>Shopping at the local market</strong><br>
        There are also a few fixed price boutiques for those who prefer not to haggle, stocking imaginative African designer clothing and adapted European styles. Most hotels now have a minimarket nearby with a selection of groceries, bottled water and soft drinks.<br>
It always pays to buy your bottled water from these mini-markets as the water in the hotels can be expensive.

An authentic African experience can be encountered at the markets in Serrekunda, Bakau and Banjul - but it is not always for the faint hearted. It is truly an education to see how the locals socialise and shop for their everyday needs.

      <p><strong>Health and Safety:</strong><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Be sure to bring your own sunscreen, stomach medication and insect repellent, as they tend to be expensive in Gambia. Travelers are also advised to get health insurance. If you are carrying prescription drugs, put them in labeled containers.</li>
<li>
Water in resorts and urban areas is generally safe to drink, but do not consume unpasteurized milk unless it is boiled. Fruits must be washed and peeled, while fish, vegetables and meat should be properly cooked.
</li>
<li>
Giardiasis and other diarrhea-related diseases are common in Gambia. Travelers should avoid paddling or swimming in stagnant fresh water to avoid schistosomiasis or bilharzia. You should also be careful of getting hepatitis E which is widespread, and the endemic hepatitis B.
