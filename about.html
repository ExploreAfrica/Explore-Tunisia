		<h1>History</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
   <strong> The Pre-Colonial Era</strong>
   <br>
   Gambian history before the arrival of Europeans has been preserved to some degree in oral traditions. Its history is closely tied to that of neighbouring Senegal, since it was only in the late 19th century that a distinction was made between Senegal and The Gambia; until that time the region is often referred to as Senegambia.

The Malinke and Wolof kingdoms, fully established by the 19th century, were still in the formative stages when the Venetian explorer Alvise Ca’ da Mosto (Cadamosto)—in the service of Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator—arrived in 1455. The Malinke were the westernmost peoples of the old Mali empire. The Wolof probably migrated from the Songhai regions, and the Fulani pastoralists were part of a migration from the Futa Toro. Although locally powerful, none of the small Gambian kingdoms were ever strong enough to dominate Senegambia. Continuing internecine warfare made it easy for the French and British to dominate the territory.<br>
<strong>European Colonization</strong><br>
The first Europeans in the Gambia River regions, the Portuguese, established trading stations in the late 1400s but abandoned them within a century. Trade possibilities in the next two centuries drew English, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Courlander trading companies to western Africa.

A struggle ensued throughout the 18th century for prestige in Senegambia between France and England, although trade was minimal, and no chartered company made a profit. This changed in 1816 when Capt. Alexander Grant was sent to the region to reestablish a base from which the British navy could control the slave trade. He purchased Banjul Island (St. Mary’s) from the king of Kombo, built barracks, laid out a town, and set up an artillery battery to control access to the river. The town, Bathurst (now Banjul), grew rapidly with the arrival of traders and workers from Gorée and upriver. The Gambia was administered as a part of British West Africa from 1821 to 1843. It was a separate colony with its own governor until 1866, when control was returned to the governor-general at Freetown, Sierra Leone, as it would remain until 1889.

British domination of the riverine areas seemed assured after 1857, but the increasing importance of peanut cultivation in Senegal prompted a new imperialism. By 1880 France controlled Senegal; in the 1870s the British attempted twice to trade the Gambia to France, but opposition at home and in the Gambia foiled these plans. Complicating matters was the series of religious conflicts, called the Soninke-Marabout Wars, lasting a half century. Only one Muslim leader, Maba, emerged who could have unified the various kingdoms, but he was killed in 1864. By 1880 the religious aspect had all but disappeared, and the conflicts were carried on by war chiefs such as Musa Mollah, Fodi Silla, and Fodi Kabba.<br>

<strong>British Protectorate</strong><br>
As a result of a conference in Paris in 1889, France ceded control of the Gambia River to Britain, and the present-day boundaries of the Gambia were drawn. In 1900 Britain imposed indirect rule on the interior, or protectorate (established in 1894), dividing it into 35 chiefdoms, each with its own chief. The real power was concentrated in the British governor and his staff at Bathurst.

Except for some trouble with slave-raiding chiefs, the Gambia enjoyed peace after its separation from Sierra Leone. Slavery was abolished throughout the protectorate in 1906. During World War II the Gambia contributed soldiers for the Burmese campaign and was used as an air-staging post.<br>

<strong>Post-Independence</strong><br>
Political parties were late in developing, but by 1960 there were several demanding independence. Britain, believing that eventually the Gambia would merge with Senegal, gave the territory revised constitutions in 1954, 1960, and 1962 and finally granted it independence within the Commonwealth in February 1965. The Gambia became a republic on April 24, 1970. The first president, Sir Dawda Jawara, head of the People’s Progressive Party (PPP), was returned in all elections after 1972. In 1981 an attempt to overthrow the government was put down with the aid of Senegalese troops after heavy fighting in Banjul. In the aftermath, leaders of both countries created the confederation of Senegambia. This plan called for each state to retain independence of action in most areas, but military and economic resources were to be integrated. A Senegambian executive and legislature were also established, but the confederation was dissolved in 1989.<br>

Mean temperatures range from 23 °C (73.4 °F) in January to 27 °C (80.6 °F) in June along the coast, and from 24 °C (75.2 °F) in January to 32 °C (89.6 °F) in May inland.

	<div data-role="content">
    <img src="coat-icon.png" style="float: left; padding: 3px 3px 0px 3px;">
    The coat of arms of The Gambia has been in use since 18 November 1964. It depicts two lions holding an axe and hoe, supporting a shield that depicts another pair of hoe and axe, crossed. Atop the shield is set the heraldic helmet and an oil palm as a crest. At the bottom is the national motto: Progress - Peace - Prosperity.<br>
    <strong><em>Overview </em></strong><br>
    The two lions represent the colonial history of The Gambia as part of the British Empire. The crossed axe and hoe represent the importance of agriculture to The Gambia. T
hey are also considered to represent the two major ethnic groups of The Gambia: the Mandinka and the Fulani. The crest, a palm tree, is also a vital national tree.

The design was created by Nicholas Potin, a government employee with the Department of Surveys, who won a national competition to design it. </div>

Our promise we renew; 
Keep us, great God of nations,

	  <p><strong>The formal education system in The Gambia operates on a 6-3-3-4 system:</strong></p>
		<ul>
  <li>6 years of Lower Basic School with  (ages 7-13) - Grade six placement exam.</li>
<li>3 years of Upper Basic School with (ages 13-16) - Basic Education Certificate Exam.</li>
<li>3 years of Senior Secondary School with (ages 16­19) -West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE).</li>
<li>4 years of University (undergrad) - Bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</li>
</ul>
<strong> History of The Gambian Education</strong><br>
<strong>Primary Education:</strong>  Education in the Gambia takes place in 5 stages, namely lower basic, upper basic and secondary school, followed by undergraduate and graduate university. Although the 6 years of lower basic education at least is compulsory and free, a lack of universal facilities prevents this from becoming a reality for some. There is a selection examination at the end of this period which is the hurdle to continuing further.

<strong><br>
Middle Education: </strong>Lower basic education continues for another 3 years leading to a junior school certificate.

<strong><br>
Secondary Education: </strong>
Those students whose parents can afford the cost of ongoing education and forgo an extra family income too, enjoy the relative luxury of 3 years at senior secondary school. Their core curriculum includes English language, mathematics, integrated science and social studies. They also take 3 – 4 elective subjects too, which may center on commerce, science or the arts. Finally, they sit for their west african senior secondary certificate examination.

<strong><br>
Vocational Education: </strong>
The Gambian Technical Training Institute was established in 1983 to manage programs in association with City & Guilds, Pitman Training UK and the Royal Society of the Arts. Its programs have expanded considerably in the interim, and it now offers more than 60 courses.

<strong><br>
Tertiary Education: </strong>
Gambia Education The Gambia College provides non-degree training in agriculture, science, nursing and midwifery, education, catering, and management. 
<p>
The University of the Gambia was established in 1999, and offers undergraduate programs in humanities & social studies, economics & management science, and nursing and public health. It also offers 6 year courses in medicine and surgery too. </p>
