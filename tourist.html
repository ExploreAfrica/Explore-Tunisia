   <strong>Gambia River:</strong>	
    <img src="tourist/gambia_river.jpg" alt=""/>
   The Gambia River (formerly known as the River Gambra) is a major river in West Africa, running 1,130 kilometres (700 mi) from the Fouta Djallon plateau in north Guinea westward through Senegal and the Gambia to the Atlantic Ocean at the city of Banjul. It is navigable for about half that length. The river is strongly associated with the Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, which consists of little more than the downstream half of the river and its two banks.<br>
   From the Fouta Djallon, the river runs northwest into the Tambacounda Region of Senegal, where it flows through the Parc National du Niokolo Koba, then is joined by the Nieri Ko and Koulountou before entering the Gambia at Fatoto. At this point the river runs generally west, but in a meandering course with a number of oxbows, and about 100km from its mouth it gradually widens, to over 10km wide where it meets the sea. <br>
   Near the mouth of the river, near Juffure, is Kunta Kinteh Island, a place used in the slave trade which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The aquatic fauna in the Gambia River basin is closely associated with that of the Sénégal River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness is moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.

Oysters are harvested from the River Gambia by women and used to make oyster stew, a traditional dish in the Cuisine of Gambia.

     Abuko National Park is a nature reserve in the Gambia lying south of the town of Abuko. It is a popular tourist attraction and was the country's first designated wildlife reserve.<br>
     <strong>History</strong><br>
The area was first accorded some measure of protection in 1916 when the Lamin Stream, which flows through the reserve, was fenced to form a water collection point. The enclosure of the stream saw an increase in the stock of wildlife and flora in the forest.

In 1967 wildlife officer Eddie Brewer and his daughter Stella Marsden visited the area and realised the conservation importance of the forest and its wildlife. Brewer made a request to the government for the area to be protected. In 1968 the Department of Wildlife, now the Gambia Department of Parks and Wildlife Management was established at the reserve.
<p><strong>Flora</strong><br>
The flora consists of a typical savanna and gallery forest landscape. Typical trees, up to thirty feet high, are: oil palm, mahogany, iroko and anthocleista procera.</p>

<p>
<strong>Fauna</strong><br>
There are a three primate species: vervet monkeys, red colobus monkeys and patas monkeys. Other mammals include antelope, squirrel, porcupine, African palm civets, mongooses, galagos, and several types of rodents, including cane rats.<br>

Among the reptiles at the park are monitor lizard, Nile crocodile, dwarf crocodile, spitting cobra, black cobra, python, puff adder and green mamba. More than 270 bird species have been recorded in the forest. There are also numerous butterflies and moths.
<br>
At one end of the site are several enclosures which serve as an orphanage for needy animals, including an enclosure in which a pack of hyenas is held.

    The Kachikally crocodile pool is located in the heart of Bakau, Gambia, about 10 miles (16 km) from the capital Banjul. It is one of three sacred crocodile pools used as sites for fertility rituals. The others are Folonko in Kombo South and Berending on the north bank.
    <p>
    <strong>Ownership</strong><br>
Kachikally is a privately owned shrine belonging to the Bojang family of Bakau, one of the founding families and major land owners of the city. Kachikally is also the name of the central district of Bakau town; other districts are Sanchaba and New Town.
    </p>
    
    <p>
<strong> Crocodiles</strong><br>
Visitors are able to touch the crocodiles
The exact number of crocodiles is not known but it is estimated that there are about 80. All the animals are Nile crocodiles which can grow to 4.5 metres and live as long as a man. There have been reports of the presence of albino crocodiles, adding to the uniqueness of the place. Perhaps the most famous crocodile was Charlie, who like all other crocodiles was allowed to roam freely, and can be approached and touched by visitors. Crocodiles found in the wild are sometimes taken to and reared at the holy pools.

  <strong>The Gambia National Museum</strong> is a Gambian cultural museum located in Banjul. It is home to historical documents and displays concerning the History of the Gambia.
  <p>
 <strong> History</strong><br>
The Gambia National Museum opened in 1985, fifteen years after the Friends of the National Museum Association was established in 1970. The 1974 Monuments and Relics Act followed, which set into motion the plans for the National Museum. The museum’s primary goal is the collection and preservation of artifacts documenting the material culture of the Gambia, as well as to educate both visitors to the country and residents who may not be familiar with Gambian history.<br>

Discussions about starting a national museum started in the 1960s, and for the two decades leading up to the museum’s inauguration, historians and archaeologists collected artifacts and information on Gambian and West African history and culture. Bakari Sidibe, Abdoulie Bayo and Baba Ceesay were pioneer staff of the new museum.<br>

At the Gambia National Museum, you can learn about the cultural heritage of the Gambia, like who the Super Eagles were and what a masquerade is. In late 1999, Hassoum Ceesay, a new graduate in history became Curator and soon worked with his superior officer, Baba Ceesay, to revamp a part of the original exhibition with a display on the history and Culture and Banjul, the capital. As curator Hassoum also instituted children's museum activities such as art classes and history video shows, and a robust fine art temporary art exhibition programme which exhibited paintings and sculpture by Gambian and foreign artists.
  </p>  
  
  <p>
  <strong>Museum Description</strong><br>
The museum houses three floors of exhibits. The ground floor displays the political and cultural history of the nation’s capital, Banjul. On the basement level, you can learn about the musical heritage of the Gambia and see what instruments are popular throughout the country and on the second floor, you can learn about the archaeological history of West Africa and the Gambia. The floor also details the nation’s colonial and post- Independence political and economic history. The museum has got a sound educational value. Gambian School children form the largest group of visitors, and the museum education programme of art classes, quiz, history video shows etc. have become supplementary to civics and social studies classes. The museum is also the most important tourist attraction in the Greater Banjul Area. It is playing its role in tourism promotion. Of course, the museum embodies the countries cultural and historical identity with its photo archives detailing over 70 years of Gambian history.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <strong>Administration</strong><br>
The Gambia National Museum is not an autonomous public body. It falls under the administrative purview of the National Centre for Arts and Culture, NCAC. The National Centre for Arts and Culture (NCAC) is a semi autonomous institution established by an Act of Parliament in 1989 to promote and develop Gambian Culture. It takes care of performing and fine arts, copyright, sites and monuments and museums. There are other public museums under the stable of the NCAC: Arch 22 museum in Banjul; Slavery museum in Juffureh; Wassu Stone Circles Museum at Wassu, 300 km from Banjul; Fort Bullen Museum in Barra, and the Culture museum at Kerr Batch Stone circles site in the Central River Region. Kachikally sacred crocodile museum in Bakau, 15 km outside Banjul and Tanji village museum are privately run.

        <h1>Gashaka-Gumti Park</h1>
            <a href="#cross" data-role="button" data-icon="arrow-r" data-iconpos="right">Next</a>

    <img src="tourist/gashaka.jpg" alt=""/>
  Gashaka-Gumti National Park is located in the mountainous region of north-eastern Nigeria adjacent to the international border with Cameroon, and immediately to the north of Mambilla Plateau. The largest and most scenic of all the seven National Parks, this conservation area lies between latitude 60 55’ and 80 05’ north, and longitude 11011’ and 12013’ east and covers a total area of 6,731 sq.km. Located in Adamawa and Taraba States, the Park is contiguous with Faro and Tchabal Mbado National Parks in the Republic of Cameroon.

The Park experiences varying pleasant weather conditions, depending on one’s location within the Park. These range from tropical dry humid, tropical moist humid in the lowlands to sub tropical highland weather on the high plateau around Chappal waddi, Sabere and Fillinga. Infact , the hidden corner of West Africa ,that is Gashaka-Gumti National Park, is surely one of Africa’s best kept secret.

  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Antropogenic features: </strong>The Park also contains some historic sites one of which is the pre 1918 German fort and garrison top of Gashaka Hill once used as a “ watch tower ” by the German military expedition to that area. Graves of some fallen German soldiers could still be seen dotted around the Fort. Similarly, there is an English fort near Gashaka village built by the British Frontier Force who overthrew the Germans to gain the Mambilla pass(a narrow corridor that gave access into Cameroon through the Mambilla Plateau in those days).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Vegetation/ Fauna species:</strong> The Park has five distinct ecological zones ranging from Scrub and Guinea Savanna to fringing lowland rainforest, montane forest . The graduation of these ecosystems are based on both the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients of the biogeography of the Park.

The mix of these latitudinal and altitudinal gradients has resulted in the evolution of a staggering variety of habitats and niches which have allowed for a diverse assemblage of biodiversity, some endemic to thrive. Infact, the Park is an intricate mosaic of montane grasslands, savanna grasslands, wood lands, swamps, lakes, rivers, evergreen and luxuriant, montane rainforest, each supporting its unique community of plants and animals.

The fauna species inventory of this Park includes giant forest hog, leopard, yellow-backed duiker, golden cat , and eight of Nigeria’s known 23 Primates including chimpanzees in the forest ecotone .The savannas are home to buffalo, lion, elephant and wild dog , water-buck, roan-antelope, giant-eland, kob and Hartesbeest. Up in the mountains one can encounter the mountain reedbuck, black and white colobus monkey, baboon, warthog, oribi and klipspringer. Whilst the crystal-clear rivers contain hippos, crocodiles, otters, nile perch and a wide variety of other aquatic communities.
An abundance of birdlife, such as pin tailed whydah, variable sunbird, dove, horn bill, grey plantain eater, african pied wagtail, african black sunbird e.t.c. Butterflies and other insect communities, orchids , flowers and woody trees make this a naturalists paradise.

Gashaka- Gumti National Park is also reputed to be a safe haven for highly endangered migratory species of animals such as elephant, wild dog and colobus monkey, red-river hog, yellow-backed duiker, reedbuck, chimpanzee, etc.
It is an important spawning ground for a variety of fish and other aquatic species that complete their life cycle in the Benue River system. These include the Nile Perch , Lates niloticus, Tilapia, Tilapia zilli, Electric fish, etc. Indeed researchers from the UK have discovered the presence of certain species of fish of the genera Bryconaethiops and Gabiocichla hitherto unknown to science.

The Park also serves as an important watershed for Rivers Benue and Taraba.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sport fishing:</strong> Gashaka-Gumti has ideal spots for sport-fishing, one of which is at Mayo Kam near the Hippo-pool. In the dry season the water is crystal clear and one can easily see different varieties ranging from Tiger, Cat fish, Nile perch, Tilapia fish gliding in the water.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Mountaineering:</strong> Gashaka Sector of the Park has rugged undulating mountain terrains, excellent for mountaineering and cave exploration. It contains the highest mountain summit in Nigeria the “Chappal Waddi”, which literally means “ the mountain of death”
standing at an altitude of 2,400 meters’ above sea level. It is located in the Gotel mountain range. It is characterized by steep, forested slopes, deep plunging valleys, precipitous escarpments and swift flowing rivers, streams, hot springs, deep valleys, and waterfalls.

<br>
<strong>Primate watching:</strong> Forests in Chappal Waddi, Chappal Hendu, Chappal Yumti, Chappal sirgu and Kwano forest are good primate strongholds. One is sure to sight chimpanzees here or at least hear their calls or see their nests. <br>
<strong>Wilderness trekking:</strong> Gashaka-Gumti National Park , wild and scenic areas are accessible only by footpath and only by trekking can one savor
the tranquility through the forest canopy ,rare fauna, crystal clear forest streams, waterfalls and picturesque mountain views. <br>
<br>
<strong>Access to the park:</strong> Gashaka sector of the park can be accessed through Katsina Ala-Takum-Bali-Serti –Bodel Gate and the other from Jalingo- Mutum Biyu-Bali-Serti-Bodel Gate, while the main access to Gumti sector is from Yola-Mayo Belwa-Ganye-Sugu-Toungo. The closest airport is at Yola. However, there is an airstrip for light aircraft in Serti, which could be used by visitors. <br>
<br>
<strong>Accomodation: </strong>At present the Park has limited furnished accommodation facilities in Serti town, Gashaka Base Camp and Toungo. Good
Camping sites also exit within and around the park; Mayo-kam, Mayo-gashaka, Mayo-gamgam and Yakuba for outdoors camping. It has about 500km of road network and several Ranger posts at strategic locations to facilitate effective visitor reception and Park protection.

The fauna species inventory of the park is very rich, with many of them endemic to the area. There are 23 species of primates in Nigeria, 18 of which are found here. Two of them very important hominoids: the Cross River gorilla, (gorilla gorilla deihli) and the chimpanzee (pantroglodytes).

The Cross River gorilla is significant, as the only colony of gorilla in sub-saharan Africa. In Nigeria, gorilla tracking is best done here; it is an all year round activity. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with Cameroonian counterpart, is assiduously working towards  ensuring its protection and survival of this critically endangered gorilla species. Two new species of butterfly have also been discovered in the park – tetrahanis okwangwo and Thermoniphas barahingam. Chevrotain, giant pangolin, the golden potto or calabar angwantibo and preuss’ guenon are also some of the mammalian species endemic to the park. Also important is the once considered extinct but now resurfaced bird, the bare-headed foul rock fowl picarthates oreas these “ecostars” are ‘a must – see’, that warrant a visit to the park!

Cross River National Park is thus important as a home to 199 mammal, 63 frog and toad, 20 reptile, 380 bird 48 fish and 950 butterfly species. Complimenting this is the park’s community of 105 support zone villages- the people who traditionally live on the forest. However, animal sighting in high rainforest parks such as the Cross River National Park is rare due to low visibility of the rainforest vegetation. Visitors are therefore advised to spend more time in the field.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Visitor facilities:</strong> Butatong Base camp in Okwangwo Division is furnished with an arboretum, picnic garden lodges and network of nature trails. A visitor can patiently take a walk into the rainforest, spend time appreciating the arboretum, relax in the garden or enjoy the tranquil environment of our eco-lodges.

Akamkpa: A modesty furnished 4- bedroom Guest House complete with electricity and water supplies as well as TV facilities. Also available is a 20-bedspace hostel for students and other low budget travelers.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Kanyang tourist village:</strong><br>
The ultimate viability of ecotourism in this park and indeed Cross River state lies in the development of the kanyang tourist village. This will enhance the exploitation of the unlimited ecotourism resources of the Mbe Gorilla mountains, the Afik mountain wildlife sanctuary, the pandrilus primates conservation project, buanchor and the Obudu mountain resort  with its captivating all-year- round temperate  climate, cable car, water park and panoramic rolling hills. The great compliment to the Calabar Free Trade Zone and the famous Tinapa Business and Leisure Resort. It is therefore an untapped goldmine awaiting interested private investors.<br>
<br>

<strong>Tinapa:</strong> Tinapa is Africa’s premier Business and Leisure Resort. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria, and indeed Africa and modeled  after similar centres in Hong kong, Singapore, Dubai, Bombay, Taiwan and Bangkok. It is a useful place to visit while on tour to Cross River National Ppark. <br>
<br>
<strong>Visitation period</strong>: The best time to visit the park is November to May. Due to its highly forested nature and criss-crossing streams, recreational pursuits are done mostly on foot with patient endurance. Armed rangers and park interpreters are available to guide visitors while on tour of the park.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Cultural features</strong>: Cross-River state has rich and diverse cultural heritage given its linguistical plurality, which is a great compliment to the existence of the Cross river National Park. Activities like the annual boat regatta, New yam festival, the famous Christmas carnival and menus such as the popular “edikangikong “ cuisine add colour to the natural endowments of the state.

<strong><br>
<br>
Accessibility and road links:</strong> Visitors from the north can access the park either through makurdi- ikom highway or yola-katsina  Ala-ikom highway. From Ikom, visitors can proceed either to Butatong or Akpamkpa depending on their interests.

Visitors from the south-west and south east can also reach the park by either Aba-Calabar highway, or Port Harcourt- Ikot Abasi  Uyo-Calabar highway. At Odukpani junction, visitors are to turn left and  make a 20-minute drive to the park Head Office at Akamkpa town where able staff will receive and guide them accordingly. Butatong and Erokut are the main entrances to the park.

Cross River National park is the only National park within the vicinity of a seaport. Sailports and passengers wishing to visit the park may berth at the calabar international free trade zone seaport. Once through with the seaport familiarities, visitors may either go straight to Akpamkpa or visit the park’s contact office at the federal secretariat complex, M/M Highway, Calabar, for further enquiries.

<strong><br>
<br>

Air Link</strong>: The closest airport is the Margaret Ekpo International Airport calabar. Visitors can hire a vehicle from either the airport or the park’s management for onward transit to the park. Those wishing to visit the Okwangwo sector by air may do so using the Bebi airstrip.

The Mambilla plateau is a high grassland plateau with an average elevation of about 1,524 metres (5,000 ft) above sea level, making it the highest plateau in Nigeria. The plateau which has an undulating landscape free of insects, also has temperate climate within a tropical region.

Located in the highland region of Taraba State of Nigeria, Mambilla plateau houses Chappal Waddi mountain considered as the highest point in Nigeria and probably in West Africa with an average height of about 2,419 metres (7,936 ft) above sea level.

As soon as one reaches the top of the mountain, the hot weather witnessed at the foot of the mountain disappears and you will be greeted by fresh and very chilled breeze blowing across the plateau.

Mambilla people of Nigeria and Cameroon live on the Mambila Plateau (in Taraba State in Nigeria) and on the Tikar Plain in Cameroon as well as in several small villages further north towards the town of Banyo. These people regard themselves as a group with a common identity.

At an altitude of some 700 m these villages live in a different ecological zone where oil palms grow and gallery forest is found. The Mambila language is a congeries of dialects and related languages.<br>
<br>
