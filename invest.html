		<h1>Agricultural Sector</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
   <strong> Opportunities in Agriculture Sector</strong>
	  <p>
      This sub-sector is becoming a major economic activity in the Gambia due to its vast export market opportunities and conditions favoring its production in the country. There are a number of farms in this area with an average weekly export for 11 selected farms estimated at 120 tons of fruits and vegetables. Land can be obtained from traditional land owners through the Government. The process of land allocation for agriculture involves obtaining clearance from Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources before final approval is given by Ministry of Local Government and Lands.<br>
The expansion in cold storage and dry cargo facilities at the Banjul International Airport compared with the demand in the export markets gives an added advantage to exporters. There are considerable investment opportunities in the sub-sector and the concept of centralized marketing that would ensure maximizing earning capacities of women and other small-scale growers, would be considered favorably. There are several large farm owners with significant investments in boreholes and equipment, seeking joint ventures. <br>
There are no significant investments in agro processing; however, given the size of annual imports of commodities such as fruit juice and sauces, roasted confectionery nuts, chicken feed , and dairy products, the sub-sector offers immense investment opportunities. There is a need for establishing a fruit juice processing industry to cater for the surplus on exports of fresh mangoes, oranges, tomatoes, and other fruits. Production of hot pepper sauce tomato paste and processing of wheat flour will go a long way towards reducing their annual import requirements. Similarly, establishment of a feed mill will complement investments in the livestock sector. These products have greater export opportunities to the sub-region as well as meeting demand due to expansion in our tourism industry.	  </p>

		<h1>Minerals Sector</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
      
      <p>
      The following minerals have been identified in The Gambia following some mineral exploration programmes conducted with the lead participation of the Geological Department. The Government continues to monitor research findings on the possibility for more mineral deposits, especially those with higher marketing value whilst staying mindful of conservation and environmental preservation issues. There are known deposits of:<br>

<strong>a) Quartz Sand </strong><br>
Large reserves of quartz (silica) sand, suitable for glass manufacture, have been identified in the Greater Banjul Area, notably in Abuko, Brufut, Darsilami (Western Division); Mbankam and Bakendik (North Bank Division); and Kaiaf, (Lower River Division). The Government continues to seek interested investors to exploit these deposits.<br>

<strong>b) Heavy Mineral Beach Sand Deposits </strong><br>
The raised beach sand, which is characteristic of The Gambia's coastal beaches, contain ilmenite, rutile, and zircon. The deposits were briefly mined in the past and recently the Government is keen in attracting interested investors in exploiting the deposits. 
The estimated reserves of recoverable minerals yield a conservative total of about 995,000 tonnes at a 1% cut-off grade. Further investigations will be conducted to update the reserve base of these minerals.<br>

<strong>c) Hydro Carbon Potential</strong><br>
The Gambia depends on imported petroleum products. The government recognises the critical need for secure and stable supply of petroleum products and the need to stabilise prices to avoid induced inflation. The government therefore welcomes potential investors and collaborators in improving storage. In regards to petroleum prospects (hydro carbon potential), The Gambia has promising prospects and the government is relentlessly collecting, updating and storing the relevant seismic data and marketing the prospects to interested oil companies and businesses. <br>

<strong>d) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)</strong><br>
All liquefied petroleum gas in The Gambia is imported overland from Senegal. LPG is mostly used for domestic purposes and on a limited scale for industrial purposes. Transaction costs in importing and bottling gas have resulted in large price differentials between Senegal and The Gambia. This makes gas unaffordable to most Gambians, and hence constituting a severe limitation on the promotion of the use of LPG.

	<div data-role="content"><strong>Investment opportunities in Fishing Sector</strong>
<br>
There are a number of enterprises in this sector seeking joint venture and/or financing for expansion and modernization of their plant to meet rapid increases in demand for Gambian fish products in the export markets. Investors in the fisheries sector are accorded development incentives and also assisted by identifying export markets. There are only three companies with processing facilities of which two are operating. Pelican Seafood Company and ScanGambia Shrimps Limited have very good infrastructure facilities but are currently under receivership. Potential buyers are welcome to make a turn-around of these companies.

		<strong>Investment opportunities in Tourism sector</strong><br>
        Tourism sector continues to play a dominant role in the Gambia's economic development process. The sector provides employment opportunities as well as enhances foreign exchange earnings for the country. The number of visitors to the country in 1991/92 was estimated at 109,164 of which Air Chartered Tourists accounted for 60% of the total. The estimated average daily expenditure for tourist for the period under review, was D300.00, and gross earnings was estimated at D432.00 million. The number of hotel beds was 5070 for 22 hotels operating- during this period.
The government is committed to an orderly development and expansion of the sector to include cultural and eco-tourism in order to maximize the benefits from tourism. In this regard, the expansion of infrastructures to designated tourism development areas including natural forest parks, land marks and monuments of cultural significance, are considered under the sector's development strategy. Effective marketing and promotional strategies for the U.S. markets and other European destinations is currently under review and it is anticipated that these strategies will take-off in mid 1994.
There are number of hotel development projects seeking for joint venture and/or financing including, construction of 5 Star hotels, bar and restaurants, and recreation facilities. However, the immediate investment priority for the sector is in tour operations targeting the Middle-East, U.S. and Europe. Investments in airline operations linking the Gambia and the targeted destinations have greater potentials and will give impetus to the growth and development of the Gambian tourism industry.
